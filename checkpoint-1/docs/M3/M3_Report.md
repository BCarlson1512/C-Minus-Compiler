This project was heavily based on/inspired by resources provided by Dr. Fei Song's compilers content. We were provided a rough idea of the implementation process as well as a portion of starter code. The grammars created in CUP are heavily based off the the C- specs. The absyn class structure is heavily based off of lecture content.
